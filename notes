#couldnt get /dev/ttyUSB0 to stick around. Would appear and disappear!
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/696001/dev-ttyusb0-is-available-but-after-try-to-call-its-gone

solution:
plug the rplidar A1
sudo dmesg 
found that "brltty" was claiming the port
solution was to sudo apt remove brltty

Also added user to the dialout group


#to start the laserscan in rviz using docker
first connect the lidar to the usb terminal 
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

pass this to the device to the docker container running ros.
make sure to include the setup.bash file under install folder to the ~/.bashrc

$ ros2 run rplidar_ros rplidar_node  # for RPLIDAR A1/A2
$ ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0  world laser_frame  # this is to transform fixed frame to laser .

$ rviz2    # change Fixed Frame option from fixed_frame to laser_frame and add LaserScan
